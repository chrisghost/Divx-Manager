Divx-Manager
============

Divx manger for home server

Plugin chrome mac : http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/40724/vlc-web-plugin


Streamer
--------

Streamer allows you to stream the video files in webm or ogg.

**Notes**
If the video file has multiple audio tracks it seems like it will only play one in Chrome's video player, though it runs fine on Firefox.
